# 🛍️ Simple eCommerce CRUD CLI

A simple **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** eCommerce product manager built with **Node.js** using **TypeScript**, **commander** and **MongoDB**.

This tool allows you to manage a product catalog directly from your terminal — list, search, add, update, and delete products — all stored securely locally or in the cloud using MongoDB.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📋 **List all products**
- 🔍 **Get a product by ID**
- 🏷️ **Search products by tag**
- ➕ **Add new products**
- ✏️ **Update existing products**
- ❌ **Delete products**

Each product has:

- A unique `_id` automatically generated by MongoDB
- A `created_at` timestamp automatically assigned using `new Date()` when a product is added

## 🗂️ Data Structure

Products are stored in MongoDB Atlas with the following schema:

```bash
{
  _id: ObjectId, (automatically generated by MongoDB)
  name: String,
  stock: Number,
  price: Number,
  tags: [String],
  created_at: Date (automatically generated using new Date())
}
```

Example product:

```bash
{
  _id: ObjectId('68f8c71bf3a37cd0f4e8c2ec'),
  name: "Wireless Mouse",
  stock: 100,
  price: 25.99,
  tags: ["electronics", "accessories"],
  created_at: 2025-10-22T11:59:23.808+00:00
}
```
